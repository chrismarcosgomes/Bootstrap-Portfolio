                <p>I am 21 years old and I am new to Web Development. I am hoping to learn a lot from this class
                    but I know that it will be very challenging at first but after many hours of practice im sure that my skills will improve.
                    I am doing Web Development because I believe that it is a very difficult skill to learn that is the way of the future.
                    I use to be a Tech Lead at a Dealership  but I did not just want to be a auto tech forever due to the toll that it takes on your body  
                        since I have burnt my hands and arms before when working on cars/trucks, and I started to have back pain. I enjoy working on cars but it is not a 
                        life long career that can be done for many years without taking injuries to your body. These are some of my reasons for changing careers 
                        and why I want a career as a Developer.
